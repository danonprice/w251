    "Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 . In the time allowed, how many images did you annotate?\n",
    "\n",
    "> 218 images were annotated in the time alloted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 . Home many instances of the Millennium Falcon did you annotate? How many TIE Fighters?\n",
    "\n",
    "> 161 instances of the Millenium Falcon are annotated. 187 instances of TIE Fighters are annotated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 . Based on this experience, how would you handle the annotation of large image data set?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Accumulating a large dataset of annotated images is a tedious task for an individual. I would look to outsource the annotation to crowdworkers through a service like Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 . Think about image augmentation? How would augmentations such as flip, rotation, scale, cropping, and translation effect the annotations?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The bounding boxes for annotations would be affected by the listed augmentations. The corners of the bounding boxes would move according to the augmentation. For example, a flip would require a mirrored translation of the bounding box coordinates over the flipped axis. The size of the bounding box would be affected by scaling and cropping."
